# 🎉 Welcome to DESN368 CODE + DESIGN ONE!

**Welcome to DESN368 Web Design!**  
You're viewing the instructor's course repository(repo). This serves as your reference and source for all course materials.  

**Important:** You'll fork this repository to create your own personal workspace. Think of it like this:  
- **This repo** = Course textbook (read-only, updated weekly)  
- **Your fork** = Your notebook (where you do all your work)  

**You're in the right place!** This is the DESN368 course repository maintained by your instructor.  

**What happens next:**  
1. Fork this repository (creating your own copy)  
2. Your fork becomes your personal workspace  
3. Each week, you’ll sync updates from here  
4. By semester’s end, your fork transforms into a portfolio
