# CSS Exercises - Week 3

These exercises are from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) and are designed to complement the HTML and CSS curriculum. They should be completed as instructed during the course.

**When doing these exercises, please use all documentation and resources you need to accomplish them.** You are not expected to have any of this memorized at this point. Check the docs, use Google, do what you need to do (besides checking the solutions) to get them done.

## How To Use These Exercises

1. **Review the week 3 visual notes first** (optional but recommended). If you get stuck, go back and read the content more carefully.
2. **You already have the exercise files** - they're in your week 3 folder that you copied from the course repo.
3. **For each exercise:**
   - Navigate to the exercise folder on your computer
   - Open the `README.md` file and read it thoroughly before starting any work
   - Each README has a "Self Check" list - use this to ensure you haven't missed any important details
   - Look at the `desired-outcome.png` image to see what you're working toward
4. **Complete the work in CodePen:**
   - Create a new CodePen for each exercise
   - Name the pen accordingly
   - Copy the HTML from the exercise's `index.html` file and paste it into CodePen's HTML panel
   - Copy the CSS from the exercise's `style.css` file and paste it into CodePen's CSS panel
   - Make your edits in CodePen following the instructions in the exercise's README
   - Work until your result matches the desired outcome image
5. **Submit your work:**
   - Copy your CodePen URL
   - Paste the link in the appropriate spot at the top of **this README** (the week 3 README, not the individual exercise READMEs)
   - Submit this README to Canvas
6. **Once you successfully finish an exercise**, you can check The Odin Project's example solution (link provided in each exercise README).
   - You should not check the solution until you finish!
   - If your solution differs from TOP's solution (and still passes the requirements), that is completely fine. There are always multiple approaches.

## Some Hints

- The provided example solutions put all changes at the end of the CSS file, which may duplicate some selectors. When you're working, it's best practice to add your CSS to existing selectors instead of duplicating them.
- Unless listed in the self-check section, don't worry about getting exact pixel values for things like margin, padding, and font size. These exercises test your CSS knowledge, not your ability to measure a screenshot perfectly.
- You may need to add some HTML elements to get things in the right spot. (For the first few exercises, the instructions make it explicit when this is needed.)
- You may need to add more CSS selectors. The first exercises have almost everything done for you, but as you progress, you'll need to add more selectors to get the correct result.
- **Use CodePen's console and inspector tools** to help debug any issues!
