  <h2> Six of Crows </h2>
  <h3> Chapter 2 </h3> 
  <h4> Inej </h4>
    <p>Kaz Brekker didn’t need a reason. Those were the words whispered on the streets
of Ketterdam, in the taverns and coffeehouses, in the dark and bleeding alleys of
the pleasure district known as the Barrel. The boy they called Dirtyhands didn’t
need a reason any more than he needed permission—to break a leg, sever an
alliance, or change a man’s fortunes with the turn of a card.
Of course they were wrong, Inej considered as she crossed the bridge
over the black waters of the Beurskanal to the deserted main square that fronted
the Exchange. Every act of violence was deliberate, and every favor came with
enough strings attached to stage a puppet show. Kaz always had his reasons. Inej
could just never be sure they were good ones. Especially tonight.
Inej checked her knives, silently reciting their names as she always did
when she thought there might be trouble. It was a practical habit, but a comfort,
too. The blades were her companions. She liked knowing they were ready for
whatever the night might bring</p>
