      <h2>DIY Recipes</h2>
      <p>Crafting lets you personalize your island.

Recipes can be discovered from villagers, balloons, or Nook’s shop. Experimenting with crafting allows you to design unique spaces and items for your island.

      <h2>Island Decorations</h2>
      <p>Decorating your island is a creative process that combines utility and beauty. Use paths, fences, flowers, bridges, and furniture to guide villagers and visitors. Terra-forming allows modification of rivers, cliffs, and ponds, giving you flexibility to design the island exactly as you like.
     Good design balances aesthetics and function. Group flowers to breed hybrids, arrange furniture in themed zones, and use custom designs for patterns or murals. This creates an immersive, visually appealing island that feels alive and personal.</p>
    <pre><code>

      Create themed areas (beach, forest, etc.)
      Use custom paths and designs
      Incorporate water features (ponds, rivers)
      Experiment with furniture placement
      Add lighting for ambiance</code>
    </pre>
      <h3>Decoration Tips</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use natural materials for organic aesthetics</li>
        <li>Create themed zones: garden, town plaza, beach area</li>
        <li>Place benches, lamps, and bridges strategically</li>
        <li>Mix seasonal decorations for liveliness</li>
        <li>Keep pathways clear for villagers and visitors</li>
      </ul>
