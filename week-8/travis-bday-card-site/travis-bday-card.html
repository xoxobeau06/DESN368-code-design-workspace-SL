Learning code has been a challenge for me, and there are many times that I feel uncertain or discouraged. Your patience, clarity, and consistent support made all the difference. Thank you for taking the time to answer my many emails, and rexplain concepts when I need it. It encourages me to keep going even when I am struggling. I am so grateful for the guidance you’ve provided and the confidence you’ve helped me build.
Wishing you a very happy 50th Birthday, and many more years of inspiring students with the dedication and kindness you show every day.
